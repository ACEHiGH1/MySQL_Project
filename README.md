# MySQL_Project
This project creates two GUIs that help users who do not have basic SQL skills. 
The first GUI is used to create a database and the tables needed to store an account's info if they are not found. If the database and tables already exist,
it will show the user this information and won't allow them to recreate them in order to avoid possible loss of data.
The second GUI is used by the user to modify the database without having to write a single line of code. The interface allows the user to insert data, update information
from the database, delete a record, select specific fields based on filters and clear all the records.
